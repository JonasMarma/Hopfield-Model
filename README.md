# Hopfield-Model
The Hopfield Model is a neural associative memory model in wich every pixel in an image is considered as a neuron that may have and activations of 1 or -1. Each neuron interacts with all other neurons to decide it's new value in order to minimize the total energy, converging to a pre-memorized pattern.
